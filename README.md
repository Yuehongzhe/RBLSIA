# RBLSIA
A simulation framework that generates synthetic point clouds from BIM models by mimicking real-world laser scanning devices. This tool simulates laser scanner parameters and performs ray-object intersection computations directly from .obj files exported from BIM software, producing high-fidelity point clouds for MEP analysis and dataset generation.
